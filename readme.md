# sas-open-hmeq

A modular Python pipeline for training, evaluating, and serializing a Gradient Boosting classifier on the HMEQ dataset, with optional import into SAS Model Manager via OAuth2. Also includes a CAS (Cloud Analytics Services) demo for interactive analytics.

## ðŸ“š Quick Start Guides

This project demonstrates **two different approaches** to SAS + Python integration:

### ðŸš€ **Start Here: Production-Ready Model Deployment**
**[SASCTL Guide](docs/SASCTL_GUIDE.md)** - Build, deploy, and manage production models with SAS Model Manager
*Perfect for: Enterprise deployment, version control, real-time scoring, production pipelines*

### ðŸ”¬ **Interactive Cloud Analytics**
**[SWAT Guide](docs/SWAT_GUIDE.md)** - Interactive analytics with SAS Cloud Analytics Services (CAS)
*Perfect for: Data exploration, rapid prototyping, cloud-based processing, real-time analytics*

**ðŸ’¡ Recommendation**: Start with **SASCTL** if you want to deploy models to production. Use **SWAT** for interactive analytics and exploration.

## Features

- **Modular Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns across data loading, preprocessing, training, evaluation, and serialization
- **Logging**: Comprehensive logging throughout the pipeline for better traceability and debugging
- **Error Handling**: Robust exception handling for production reliability
- **Configuration Management**: YAML-based configuration for easy experimentation
- **OAuth2 Integration**: Secure authentication with SAS Model Manager
- **CAS Analytics Demo**: Interactive analytics using SAS Cloud Analytics Services with the HMEQ dataset

## Installation

1. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3.10 -m venv venv
   # On Windows:
   venv\Scripts\activate
   # On Linux/Mac:
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade pip
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   ```bash
   # Copy the sample environment file
   cp env.sample .env
   # Edit .env with your SAS credentials and settings
   ```

## Usage

### Main Pipeline
- **Dry run (serialize only):**
  ```bash
  python run_pipeline.py --skip-import
  ```
- **Full pipeline (including SAS import):**
  ```bash
  python run_pipeline.py
  ```

### CAS Analytics Demo
Run the interactive CAS demo with the HMEQ dataset:
```bash
python cas_hmeq_demo.py
```

This demo demonstrates:
- Connecting to SAS Cloud Analytics Services (CAS) using OAuth2
- Uploading the HMEQ dataset to CAS
- Building a logistic regression model to predict loan defaults
- Building a linear regression model to predict debt-to-income ratio
- Extracting and interpreting model parameters

## Scoring with MAS

**Note:** Before using these scoring scripts, you must first publish your model to the destination: SAS Micro Analytic Service (maslocal).

This project provides two command-line scripts for scoring data using a MAS-deployed model:

### 1. score_with_mas_rest.py (Direct REST API)
- Uses direct HTTP requests to the MAS REST API.
- Good for debugging or when you need full control over the request/response.
- Outputs a CSV with predictions and (optionally) input fields.

**Example usage:**
```bash
python score_with_mas_rest.py -H https://create.demo.sas.com -m <module_name> -i data/hmeq_test.csv -o data/hmeq_scored.csv
```

### 2. score_with_mas_sasctl.py (sasctl Library, Recommended)
- Uses the official `sasctl` Python library for a higher-level, more robust interface.
- Handles authentication, session management, and error handling for you.
- Outputs a CSV with both predictions and all original input fields for traceability.
- Preferred for most users.

**Example usage:**
```bash
python score_with_mas_sasctl.py -H https://create.demo.sas.com -m <module_name> -i data/hmeq_test.csv -o data/hmeq_scored.csv
```

**Note:** Both scripts require the same environment setup (see Installation above) and should be run from the project root directory.

## Configuration

Adjust `config/params.yaml` for model parameters, data paths, and pipeline settings. Set OAuth2 credentials and SAS connection details in `.env` file (use `env.sample` as template).

## Logging

The pipeline uses Python's logging module for comprehensive output tracking:
- **INFO**: General pipeline progress and results
- **WARNING**: Non-critical issues (e.g., token refresh failures)  
- **ERROR**: Critical failures with detailed error messages

## Dependencies

Key dependencies (see `requirements.txt` for full list with versions):
- `pandas`, `numpy`: Data manipulation
- `scikit-learn`: Machine learning
- `pyyaml`: Configuration management
- `sasctl[all]`: SAS Model Manager integration
